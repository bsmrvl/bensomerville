                <p>This is a story about a tired but ever hard-working man named Perse. It is bookended by the prayers of a young, confused outsider named Benjamin, desperate to understand the strange sufferings of the new world he has entered. Most of the album is a discussion between Perse and Benjamin, except for “Mr Foreigner”, where Perse's children give their take, and "I Thought", where Perse is mostly talking to himself. The Queen, who narrates the chorus of “To Give”, is synonymous with the friends-made-at-the-age-of-ten, who are mentioned by Perse in several other songs. Good luck!</p>

<h3>Writ in Icy Night</h3><br>
<p>I can't see the letters on the page<br>but I can tell they're following the line<br>If you knew my time out here, you could gauge<br>the vigor––or its absence––in my spine<br>You'd think the association might be backwards,<br>that mulling in the cold's a hot concern<br>But really this is one of many factors<br>which blow my zest for life 'til high it burns<br><br>The stars have all begun to rub their eyes<br>The frosty toes grow urgent with their sense<br>Silhouettes of trees look more like spies<br>but fear would be a rather lame expense<br><br>Slowly now, inhale the dashing air<br>Take it, feel it, carry it everywhere<br></p>

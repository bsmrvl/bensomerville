<h3>Wet Paint</h3><br>
<p>My clothes caught the flames from pure evil<br>The jolt and the fire<br>Announced by the roar of his floored pickup<br>Like a kamikaze, but<br>Immortal, purposeless, calm in the bulletproof cab<br>Cigarette burning hotter than the pouncing flames<br><br>I'd been hiding stiff in my back seat<br>Eyes wide or eyes clenched<br>Like from a shooter<br>But it never works<br>They always sniff you out<br><br>I'm running, rolling in grass<br>Flames dissolve at the kiss of dew<br><br>I'm inside, locked<br>Where is he?<br>Hate for fun<br>Where did he go?<br><br>The scent is drenched<br>Dizzying<br>I'm happy to faint<br></p>

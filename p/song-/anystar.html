<p>I'm in the waves<br>Swimming fine<br>But there's a thick fog<br>I might be here forever<br>I guess that's fine these days<br><br>But I want to see you<br>I want to read you<br><br>Come and meet me down here<br>In the pile of people shy of people<br>I'm trying to leave the city<br>Without case or court<br><br>If I could see the stars<br>Every star<br>I wouldn't ask<br>For any specifics<br>Just take me to one, please<br><br>I want to see you<br>I want to read you<br>But I can't afford to visit you just yet<br>Someday I'll be with you<br></p>

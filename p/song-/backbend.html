<p>Looking up hurts my neck<br>More than a train to the face, baby<br>But if that's all that it takes<br>To see summer's face<br>I don't give a grade<br><br>Tell me all you want<br>What you think will fix my posture<br>But I'll keep on looking up<br><br>Looking into the sky<br>Gives me porcupine eyes<br>But if that's all it takes<br>To see summer's face<br>I don't give a grade<br><br>Tell me all you want<br>What you think will kill the violence<br>But I'll keep on looking up<br>I'm not a stubborn man<br>You are probably in the right here<br>But I'll keep on looking up<br><br>I will keep on looking up<br>Someday I'll be walking up<br></p>

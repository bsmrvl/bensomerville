<h3>Barcode | <a href="/p/album/euw"><i>Ears Under Water</i></a></h3><br>
<p>Twice a day<br>I sat and prayed for my brother's name<br>Seven hours of holy power<br>Was never quite loud enough<br><br>Thrice a week<br>I failed to speak<br>For my soul was weak<br>That didn't change the holy stage<br>But my holy rage increased<br><br>Once a month<br>I met a dove from up above<br>He told me how to look around<br>And ground my sound in you<br><br>There's more to this<br>There's more to you<br>Than one hour a day<br><br>You are here<br>You are near<br>You are very near<br></p>

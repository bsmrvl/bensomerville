<p>I wouldn't wait if I were you <br>To tell myself what to do <br>About this sinusoid <br>Pacing through the living room <br>Losing touch with the views <br>Five feet away<br><br>I don't understand what I'm feeling from up above <br>I don't understand what I'm feeling about love <br>It's all on my solstice shopping list <br>It's just a part of the cycle <br>Ready your weapons son, let's go to church now <br>Take a walk in the application if that's allowed <br>It's all on my solstice shopping list <br><br>A pair of hands, another chance <br>Infinite, in fact <br>That's the point of math <br>Pacing through the laundry room <br>Wading in detergent <br>Divergent math <br><br>I don't understand what I'm feeling from up above <br>I don't understand what I'm feeling about love <br>It's all on my solstice shopping list <br>It's just a part of the cycle <br>Tell everyone now or they'll get stuck in your head <br>Amplify with honesty, but just not quite yet <br>It's all on my solstice shopping list <br><br>Don't lose the view<br></p>

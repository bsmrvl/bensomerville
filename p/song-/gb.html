<p>Though I'm most certainly not one<br>To get things right the first time<br>I must have with you<br><br>So it's most certainly time<br>To stop looking around<br><br>I get so tired of getting it wrong<br>But that's not why I wrote this song<br>I wrote it for you<br>To tell you<br>Everything's fine<br>I'm not looking for you<br>You're looking fine<br><br>Well, I have probably spoken too much<br>But to me it seemed worth speaking, so<br><br>I wrote it for you<br>To tell you<br>Everything's fine<br>I'm not looking for you<br>You're looking fine<br><br>I get so tired of getting it wrong<br></p>

<h3>Hire A Maid | <a href="/p/album/euw"><i>Ears Under Water</i></a></h3><br>
<p>Dad hired a maid in 2008<br>Said it's more important that he not be late<br>To give half his life away<br>For mom and me and all of you<br>Mom works often at the local nonprofit<br>But she still has time to go looking for outfits<br>Strangely, they're usually for me<br>I find them in closet and I wear them without comment<br><br>But I am aware of something for which I never cared<br>All my friends count from ten<br>Then fight their ways with all the men<br>I'd like to be a fighting man<br><br>In 2015<br>Employment found me<br>Excitement threw me<br>Mornings brewed me<br>Managers scolded me<br>Freedom shunned me<br>And I loved it all<br><br>Until<br><br>I became aware<br>Of something for which I don't care<br>Setting up means tearing down<br>Beaten down<br>Cleaning crowns<br>Don't you hire a maid?<br>I said I wanted to be a fighting man<br><br>Parents are great<br>Grateful that I'm back in state<br>Mom bought me stately new shades to fill the space I couldn't erase by working late<br></p>

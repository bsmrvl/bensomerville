<p>[Perse]<br><br>Benjamin, I have some news..<br>Things I have been telling you<br>May or may not quite be true<br>What have I been telling you?<br>Brother, what's going on!<br><br>You see<br>There's a voice in me that sometimes<br>(maybe I've been dramatizing)<br>There's a voice in me that sometimes ?<br>There's a voice in me that sometimes rises!<br><br>This imaginary pain<br><br>All the past I've already said<br>I made some friends when I was ten<br>I built the world, the world turned red<br>And it was probably my fault again<br>But never again!<br><br>You see<br>I ran into one just last night and<br>Sat myself next to his tight hands<br>All our youth brought back to light<br>I watched his icy silence melt<br>All our youth brought back to light<br>I watched his icy silence melt almost to life<br><br>This imaginary pain<br><br>Brother, father<br>What is this, what have I been thinking?<br>I made a war out of hibernation<br>What is this, a dream?<br></p>

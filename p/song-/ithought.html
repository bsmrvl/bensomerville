<p>[Perse]<br><br>I don't understand my lies<br>Guess I am a smooth demise<br>Tyranny, emotions-wise<br>Cuts most deep in this reprise<br><br>Kid, I'm just trying to get home<br>Please let me atone alone<br>What's said and done is said and done<br>Oh, I feel everything I've done.<br>I'd love to be on your side!<br>But please don't seize me by my mind<br>Let's reach out from our own sides<br>Together we can run<br>Together we can run<br><br>I made some friends when I was ten<br>My only means to every end<br>Guess I've always thought too much of them<br>Ignored all my own cheated men<br>It's about time I joined them—<br></p>

<p>A circle of believers<br>Praying for the fathers<br>We have a tuner for you<br>A square of unbelievers<br>Standing with the prayers<br>Scanning all their papers<br>We have a tuner for you<br><br>We just walked across your lawn<br>But we don't tie ourselves in knots<br>We agreed to leave the questions out<br><br>How is everything so green around here?<br><br>An oval of deceivers<br>Praying for the people<br>We have a bible for you<br>A country of connivers<br>Stand with the believers<br>Sing with the believers<br>Let us tune your bible for you<br><br>Brother, let's leave the questions out<br><br>How is everything so green around here?<br></p>

Oh, come on<br>There has to be another way<br>Come for dinner, come and let me<br>Prove myself to you<br><br>Pace yourselves, friends<br>We have plenty of time to spend<br>Is this not enough?<br>Pace yourselves, friends<br>I have plenty of minds to bend<br>Is this not enough?"<br>They all looked at me and laughed<br>That's good, right?<br>Joy means someone's won some sort of fight<br>Someone affirm that bribing works around here<br><br><i>It's all you<br>It's on you</i><br>If only that were true!<br><br>A new man can't choose what he wants to do<br><br>Man, I've had it with this system<br>There has to be another way out<br>Typical, everyone versus me<br><br>"Pace yourselves, friends<br>We have plenty of time to spend<br>Is this not enough?<br>Pace yourselves, friends<br>I have plenty of minds to bend<br>Is this not enough?"<br>They all looked at me and laughed<br>Shut up, right?<br>I should have won this fight<br>Why doesn't bribery work around here?<br><br><i>It's all you<br>It's on you</i><br><br>I know it's been a while since we've had this conversation but, uh..I, I thought you wanted success?<br><br>That wasn't me!<br><br>Well it just depends on your definition of success, I guess<br></p>

<h3>Save Robert Jones | <a href="/p/album/euw"><i>Ears Under Water</i></a></h3><br>
<p>I knew a painter once<br>He spent all his money on canvas and brush<br>He told me more than once<br>About the root of all his woes<br><br>“Better, better, better<br>How I could have done it better<br>How I'd love to do away<br>With what I did yesterday<br>What I did while I was imperfect”<br><br>Get real with me<br><br>“Me, me, me<br>Work, work, work”<br><br>Sleeping on the stairs<br>Cuz you don't know<br>That they're made for climbing<br>You don't know you're hiding<br>You're outside of time<br>Ok! I'm afraid<br>That space isn't stationary<br><br>I won't say it again<br></p>

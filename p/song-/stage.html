<p>[Perse]<br><br>Once upon a long, at the turn of the cent<br>We hear our future drift over the crest<br>All the elders crying, and they drag us along<br>We don't know better than to join in song<br>A couple of us gather at the age of ten<br>We jibe at this idea of a crest<br>Let the elders cry and let them fight<br>While we create our everlasting light!<br><br>We were just children<br>Strength in numbers worked back then<br>Such a city I had never seen before<br>And for eyes like mine, never again<br>Never again!<br><br>Selfishness and its infinite hands<br><br>Little actors on the stage<br>And we thought it was all real<br>Little lovers of the stage<br>And we swore it was all real<br>Little lovers, little lovers<br>Lord I swear it was all real<br></p>

<h3>10,000 Stairs | <a href="/p/album/euw"><i>Ears Under Water</i></a></h3><br>
<p>My father took me to the mountain<br>This fine morning, and said<br>"My son, we're gonna climb that<br>We're gonna take back your joy"<br>Come on, I don't see it<br>What's the connection?<br>This and joy<br>My father, tell me now<br>Please use logic<br>How is this fun?<br><br>He said<br>I know every song in the summit show<br>But they're not stuck in my head just yet<br>Instead I let all these little steps<br>Sing to me in perfect harmony<br><br>Now evening<br>We have conquered about a third<br>Of those 10,000 stairs<br>My feet are a little angry<br>But my mind is quiet<br>My thoughts, my fears<br>Quiet<br><br>I know every song in the summit show<br>But they're not stuck in my head just yet<br>Instead I let all these little steps<br>Sing to me in perfect harmony<br></p>

<h3>The Tension | <a href="/p/album/entanglement"><i>Entanglement</i></a></h3><br>
<p>[Benjamin & <i>family</i>]<br><br>I am a foreigner, I don't know my name in this tongue<br>I'm glad to be alive here, I'd say, but it's hard to say<br>I have my family near, we dance together all day!<br>That is foreign here, I heard those are foreign words<br>My father took me out to observe<br><br>Evasion, eyes pressed in<br>Pretending they see no life<br>Stumbling away from every living thing<br><br>Yells, nothing withheld<br>Until one breaks the other's shell<br>It makes me want to run back to my mother's arms<br><br>Tension, feel the tension<br>Every single place I've been<br>It sings and somehow everybody listens<br>Listen!<br><br><i>We can't read this contradiction<br>Let us in, LET US IN LORD!<br>Oh to be a learned citizen<br>Oh to be, OH! to understand</i><br><br>But I am a foreigner, maybe it's all for nought<br>I hate to be lost all day, but I will today<br>Once again<br>Keep me in<br>Slow success<br>Amen<br></p>

<p>Look, a picture of you<br><br>The way you eye the sea<br>Although no one really has the key<br>To the palace that you built for yourself<br>Up on the cliff<br><br>Is it lying to me?<br><br>He said he wanted to be in the pages<br>So we led him to the sages<br>That's where he is now<br>He got ahead<br>That's what he said<br>But honestly, who knows now<br><br>Light a candle please<br>I don't feel at home<br>At least read me a story<br>Spin me a top<br>Let me watch<br><br>I'll never really move away from you<br><br>Light a candle please<br>I don't feel at home<br>At least give me a reason<br><br>I'll never really move away from you<br></p>

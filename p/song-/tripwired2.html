<p>I fell into a mirror and it broke<br>I looked up, someone handed me a coke<br>I looked back, took a sip but missed my lips<br>up again and she was gone<br><br>I fell into a cloud and it floated away<br>I dropped my keys, I told her I was broke<br>an afternoon gone missing, lost kissing<br>down again and she was gone<br>thank God<br><br>I fell into a bucket and read the list<br>I saw your name, I saw what I had missed<br>went to the law, they told me to desist<br>at least you aren't gone yet<br></p>

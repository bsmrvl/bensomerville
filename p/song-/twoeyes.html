<h3>Read With Two Eyes | <a href="/p/album/euw"><i>Ears Under Water</i></a></h3><br>
<p>I don't think it's very clear to you<br>What it means for me to say ok<br>Every time you give me your outlook on this<br>Nothing done grudgingly ever ends well<br>I read that somewhere<br>With one eye somewhere else<br><br>I couldn't find a book for you to read tonight<br><br>How I wish we could see the same tree<br>With all four of our eyes<br>It seems that two of yours and one of mine<br>See what serpents see<br>Not to say that I'm better than you<br>But compared to you, I read a lot<br>One eye hasn't gotten me there<br>But it's gotten me somewhere<br><br>I couldn't find anything for you to read tonight<br><br>Gonna read with two eyes open from now on<br>But since you won't<br><br>I couldn't find a book for you to read tonight<br>I won't write another story to help you make up your mind<br></p>

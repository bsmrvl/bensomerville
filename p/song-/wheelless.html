<h3>Song For The Wheelless | <a href="/p/album/euw"><i>Ears Under Water</i></a></h3><br>
<p>300 pounds who can press?<br>400 who can row?<br>I'll tell you this<br>Not Billy Mo<br>He keeps trying<br>But he's not even close<br>But he keeps trying<br>He keeps going<br><br>$500 who can save in a day?<br>$600 by tomorrow?<br>I'll tell you this<br>Not Johnny Stow<br>He keeps trying<br>But he learns so slow<br>But he keeps trying<br>He keeps going<br><br>7 officials who can impress?<br>8 who can make bestow?<br>I'll tell you this<br>Not Angela Faux<br>She keeps trying<br>But they're not buying it<br>But she keeps trying<br>She keeps going<br><br>All of these are underestimated<br>'Cause of their genetics and their situations<br>And their past decisions and their past failures<br>And the past rollers that passed them every year<br>They don't like to talk about it<br>‘Cause they know that they'll be questioned<br>“Are you serious? What have you been doing?<br>Where have you been going?”<br>Trust me, sir, I know<br>I'm just slow<br><br>Look at me<br>You're doing the right thing<br></p>
